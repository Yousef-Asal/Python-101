    "2) Write a second function which again takes a number as input, but this time checks if the number is a prime number or not and returns True or False, respectively.\n",

    "1) Here, you will need to create a function that takes a variable number of text inputs (*args) and prints each of them.\n",
    "   Optionally, it applies different types of formatting to them (only if given; **kwargs); these should include:\n",
    "    - \"letter_case\": convert all letters to either upper or lower case, selected by parsing \"upper\" or \"lower\".\n",
    "      You can use .upper() and .lower() methods on any string to achieve that.\n",
    "    - \"add_newlines\": add a newline character to the end of each given text, so there is an additional space when printing.\n",
    "      Select this via True or False.\n",
    "    - \"skip_first_n\": do not apply the formatting on the first n given texts, selected by parsing an integer.\n",
    "      You may need to implement a counter when looping over your texts.\n",
    "Hint:\n",
    "    - Use conditional statements to check if a formatting option is given, if so, apply it before printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have included 4 random texts in the code below. You will need to call your function four times, with varying inputs:\n",
    "    - Call 1: Input the first 2 texts. Do not set any formatting options.\n",
    "    - Call 2: Input the first 3 texts. Set letter_case='lower', skip_first_n=0\n",
    "    - Call 3: Input all texts. Set letter_case='upper', add_newlines=False, skip_first_n=2\n",
    "    - Call 4: Input all texts. Set add_newlines=True, skip_first_n=1\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now you will need to write a decorator function which you should use with your first function and repeat the calls with the same settings as before.\n",
    "   In order to get a nicer output to your screen, this decorator should print some framing around the text output of each function call,\n",
    "   using characters like dashes, asterisks, hashes, newlines, ..., (the exact format is up to you), e.g.:\n",
    "-------\n",
    "This is your functions text output\n",

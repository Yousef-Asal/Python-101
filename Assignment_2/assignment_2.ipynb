    "Question 1: Build a Library Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a class Book that represents a book in a library.\n",
    "Your class should make use of properties and dunder/magic methods to handle and manipulate book data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Attributes:\n",
    "        - title (string): The title of the book.\n",
    "        - author (string): The author of the book.\n",
    "        - stock (integer): The number of copies available in the library (must be a non-negative integer).\n",
    "    Properties:\n",
    "        - Create a property for stock that ensures the value is always a non-negative integer.\n",
    "          If someone tries to set a negative stock, raise a ValueError (\"raise ValueError\").\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dunder/Magic Methods:\n",
    "        - Implement the __str__ method to return a nicely formatted string with information about all attributes.\n",
    "        - Implement the __eq__ method to compare two books based on their title and author.\n",
    "        - Implement the __add__ method to allow adding two books' stocks together (e.g., book1 + book2 should return the total stock).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Additional Methods:\n",
    "        - Add a method sell_book(quantity) that reduces the stock by the specified quantity (use the stock property!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create 3 different book objects: \n",
    "book1 and book2, which have the exact same author and title but different stock.\n",
    "book3, which is something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, perform the following (make use of the dunder/magic methods!):\n",
    "    - Print all objects\n",
    "    - For all possible pairs of books, compare if they are the same, only if so, print the total stock.\n",
    "    - Pick any book and perform two different sell calls. The first one should be within the limit of available stock.\n",
    "      The second one should exceed that limit, so your stock property raises an Error.\n",

    "For each of the tasks 2.1 and 2.2 create its own class!\n",
    "The constructors (__init__) of those classes should load the image, so you need to pass the image paths at object creation time.\n",
    "The actual act of processing however should be performed using a special dunder call (__call__) method, which is executed by calling the created object.\n",
    "This call should take the parameters necessary for the operation your class is meant to perform (either crop or segment) as arguments (i.e., x/y positions for cropping or channel thresholds for segmentation).\n",
    "The rest of this __call__ method should be designed to perform the tasks as described below.\n",

    "\n",
    "2.2) - Load the saved image again into a numpy array. You now need to perform semantic segmentation of the red peppers,\n",

    "             Your result does not need to be perfect! There will most probably be some leftover background noise and/or holes in the pepper.\n",
